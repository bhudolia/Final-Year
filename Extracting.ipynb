      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Raazi does what very few Bollywood movies do right. It pulls off a tight script with good acting, and a realistic believable storyline that leaves you on the edge of your seat for two hours. The film also manages to maintain a tight pace while building up towards an impactful climax. In particular, I think three things made it unforgettable: <br/><br/>Firstly, the acting was on point, and made the movie what it turned out to be. Alia Bhatt is turning out to be an absolute genius, and has come a long way from her 'student of the year' days. There are very few in her peer-group that can do justice to these kinds of roles. Vicky Kaushal was good as the beguiled husband, and his restrained yet emotional male character (supporting a powerful female lead) is a Bollywood rarity, and was thoroughly enjoyable. The others are on point too, with minor actors like Jaideep Ahlawat and Rajit Kapoor delivering strong performances. <br/><br/>Secondly, the movie turned out to be tight and on point, with no melodramatic displays of emotion or sappy songs. The good old premises of a bride departing to her husband's household for (presumably) good, the arranged marriage with a virtually unknown man, and eventual marriage consummation were all present, in theory. These are all typically perfect opportunities to inject unnecessary bridal parting songs, lengthy wedding song and dance sequences (boy's side, girl's side, etc.) and the worst of all - a song balancing sleaze with \"Indian culture\" (read: censor board mandated restraint) that plays when the marriage is consummated (this is typically a couple kissing and rolling around in a bed, carefully clothing their privates with velvet or satin sheets). But Raazi eliminates all of this fluff and more, leaving you wishing more movies would do away with the crap in favor of keeping the pace of the plot. <br/><br/>Lastly, and most importantly, Raazi does justice to the complexity of the India-Pakistan conflict. The countries have a shared history which makes the war painfully more unique (e.g. Abdul, the oldest and most faithful caretaker in the Pakistani household is of Indian origin). The movie takes no sides, and shows you that humanity and ruthlessness exist on both sides. This is a significant departure from the patriotic films of yesteryear - we are habituated to seeing a good vs evil theme, and having Pakistanis depicted as soulless warmongers. And so, you are simply not prepared to empathize with Iqbal's (Vicky Kaushal's) gentle persona, and when you do, it his vulnerable humanity hits you like a truck. Conversely, the hardened Indian intelligence agent Mir is many things during the movie, but 'human' he is not. <br/><br/>I walked away from the theater understanding better the nature of such wars, and that the real conflict is not over Kashmir, or between two sides, or between ideologies. The real conflict is always fought within the human heart: between the ruthless imperatives of duty, and the very human urges of gentleness, mercy and love.</div>\n",

      "The director did a masterful technique of placing the audience in Sehmat's shoes, the audience is privy to the information as she receives n passes on to the Intelligence bureau.

The lead actor Alia Bhatt manages to get into skin of the character so comfortably that you forget that you are watching a movie, instead you feel the pain she is emoting. <br/><br/>What is brilliant about the film is that you keep expecting that every scene is leading you to a traditional Indo-Pak friendship kind of an ending with a stong social message. But what astonishes here is that the movie manages to remain a BRUTAL story of spy carrying out its mission through out. An out and out hardcore spy thriller with a women protagonist, so beautifully crafted that you are left spellbound. <br/><br/>Meghna Gulzar captures the simplicity of characters with so much depth that you are bound to sympathize with every character. Take a bow!<br/><br/>All actors are at par. Direction is superb. Camera work is crisp. Background score is perfect. This movie is a gem.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Based on an incredible true story, Raazi is a tribute to unknown heroes of our nation in war time zone. Directed by Meghna Gulzar, who had directed extremely well movie- Talvar in past, this film tells a story about a normal and simple Indian girl, and her journey from being a daughter to a wife and to a spy. One more factor is also there, but am not revealing now because you will get it at the end.<br/><br/>Alia Bhatt plays a character of Sehmat, who is an Indian spy married to a Pakistani military officer (Vicky Kaushal) during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 on the order of her father. Would she get success to pass on information from Pakistan to India without getting caught and to help Indian forces to stop the war or fight back to Pakistan.... For that go and watch Raazi.<br/><br/>It is an adaptation of Harinder Sikka's novel 'Calling Sehmat'. Screenplay has been written by Meghna and Bhavani Iyer. Dialogues are written by Meghna. Some dialogues are outstanding. 'Watan Ke Aage Kuch Nahi, Khud Bhi Nahi... Mohabbat Bhi Nahi!' One more is there, when one is declaring about his cancer, he says that- 'Smoking To Ki Nahi Kabhi... Magar Shayad Zindagi ke Kash Thode Lambe Le Liye...!' What a line man! Only a daughter of a great poet can write such!<br/><br/>Alia Bhatt has delivered another award winning performance. Till now in this year, she is the deserving one. First time you will see her crying. Especially, in that scene where she is asking his officer about how to balance between life, emotions and duty in war, because it is the toughest one. VIcky Kaushal is as usaul superb. He has less dialogues, but his silences speak more. The gun scene with Alia is the best scene of these two actors. Jaideep Ahlawat has done commendable job. He is always good. But this time he is on another level. Along with Rajit Kapur and Soni Razdan, rest are good, too.<br/><br/>Lyrics by Gulzar Saheb and Music by Shankar Ehsaan Loy. Dilbaro is pure Kashmiri folk song on the perfect situation of marriage saying- 'Mudke Na Dekho Dilbaro!' Raazi title track is engaging. Whenever Arijit's voice starts in the hall, some magic happens everytime in this film. School annual function song by Sunidhi and the same song in Arijit Singh's voice - 'Ae Watan'- is the best song that Gulzar Saheb can give us in this decade. What a melody man! Looks like a classic old hindi film tune. For the film situated in 1971, this is the best patriotic song one can ever make! I am so proud of this song... 'Main Jahan Rahun Jahaan Mein Yaad Rahe Tu, Ae Watan... Mere Watan!'<br/><br/>I knew that this film would be superb. But this song has uplifted it more. But the same time, it's touching the deepest portion of heart. Human is very complicated creature. Human is not a robot. For anyone, it is hard to be a robot. One can try one's best, but one can't delete the function of emotions from the body. Without emotions, there is no living. Salute to those heroes who are living without emotions so that millions of people from their countries can live happily! <br/><br/>If a girl can go to this level for her father and her nation, what can you or I do at current position! The question is unanswered by me. I am still thinking (while writing as well!) The more I think of it, the more I am getting deeper in the thought. <br/><br/>The story of a courageous girl is definitely a Must Watch. You'll feel proud of such unsung heroes of your country. Feel the emotions of them. Feel the tension of espionage. Feel the heat of war. As they say- In the War, nothing is important than War, neither you, nor me!</div>\n",

'Raazi' tells the story of one such character.<br/><br/>Among other things,the central purpose of 'Raazi' is to outline the sacrifices spies make.As one character complaints in a rather vicious manner,\"Na rishton ki qadar hai..Na jaan ki\"(you neither care for relationships nor life) The Nation comes first for these people.So much so,that even some personal relationships need to be sacrificed(atleast in this movie's case) <br/><br/>It is very,very rare to find an Indian movie that doesn't callously demean the 'enemy'.Usually,the audience is just supposed to hate the other side.Our side is always the best and the people involved think the same.Manipulative music,spoon-feeding the audience,cliched dialogues and extremely one-sided narrations usually plague Bollywood's attempts at patriotic movies.'Raazi' steers clear of all these issues.On the contrary,this movie demands an attentive viewing.The viewer is expected to remember certain details.The movie is buoyed by a taut screenplay and a brilliant central performance.Interestingly,this movie respects the patriotism on both sides.Neither side is made out to be a villain or a Hero.All characters are trying to do what's best for their country(ies)<br/><br/>\n",
      "I am delighted that such a movie has come out of India.There are some minor plot holes,but they don't affect the movie in any important way.Kudos to Meghna Gulzar for trusting the audience with such a screenplay and Kudos for bringing such a story to the public.<br/><br/>P.S.: There is something for Breaking Bad fans here too.I also got Homeland vibes from some scenes.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"content\">\n",
      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Had the second half of the movie been executed a bit more efficiently, this could've have been an outstanding spy movie from bollywood, after a very long time. The movie takes us into the life of a 20 year old college going girl, Sehmat. The story revolves around the Indo-Pak war of 1971 from a perspective unknown to the common man. How suddenly things fall apart and this young girl's life changes drastically with choices beyond her reach is what unfolds in the movie. \n",
      "THE BACKGROUND SCORE &amp; MUSIC\n",
      "The trio of Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy yet again pulls off a musical treat. The background score is aptly fitted. Every scene is filled to it's highest thrill with just the perfect blend of music and songs. Though the songs haven't been in the buzz much yet when it reflects in the movie, it just seem a pretty decent job.\n",
      "SCREENPLAY &amp; DIALOGUES\n",
      "The writing duo here of Meghna-Bhavani, seems almost flawless and picture perfect in the first half. The story is in just the fine pace, with sufficient fillers to fill in. The dialogues are written very well by Meghna gulzar. She has adapted the urdu language very efficiently in the dialogues, keeping in mind the audience and their ability to interpret. \n",
      "With the second half, the narrative slightly looses it's track. It fails to maintain that grip over the audience. As we descend towards the climax, I even felt like it started to slightly diverge from its abstraction.\n",
      "CINEMATOGRAPHY\n",
      "The era of 70's has been showed pretty decently in the movie. Jay patel doesn't disappoints with his work. His shots and perspective of some intense scenes were really an asset to the movie. There are few close up shots, if I knew any better, still I'll admit to this fact that those shots completely changes the momentum of the impact of the scene over the audience. Capturing many low light scenes with such mastery, this man has done his job very profoundly. \n",
      "ACTING \n",
      "If I be very honest then this section absolutely grabs a full star. Alia Bhatt has yet again proved her worth in the industry, she's far more than just a cute face! Her acting is simply an excellence. She is so mesmerizing to watch that a lack of a male lead and the fact that this is a female centric becomes completely oblivious, if it at all is a bother to anyone in the very first place. A huge salute to the casting director Jogi. His works reflects effortlessly on the screen, with every actor fitting just so fine in their given character's shoes and also delivering it with so much conviction.\n",
      "Vicky kaushal, Arif Zakaria and Shishir Sharma are exceptional on screen, their work is truly outstanding. Special mention to Rajit Kapoor, having so less a screen time yet managed to leave a hard impact. Truly exceptional.\n",
      "After 'Talvar' (2015), I really liked Meghna's work. She really knows her way around the script, she knows how to and when to play what. Yet it was hurtful to see the second half slipping out like that. Nevertheless it's a brilliant work by her in bringing the world of sehmat alive on screen. It's definitely a must watch if you are a person with high patriotism and/or a great fan of Alia Bhatt.\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Until the interval, the film was slowly boiling but felt like something was missing. But a powerful scene just before the interval explained the whole film in a go. Sehmat undresses herself after a killing, stands under the shower and cries - the cries crack up the heart. One surrenders to the nation irrespective of the in-depth emotions, until Raazi came up the films relied more on nation. But, Meghna Gulzar proves, Emotion is greater than Nation.<br/><br/>The complex nature of the film might come across as a defect, beneath the surface the heart is rapidly beating and the conflicts underline every character. The borders cease to exist, writers Bhavani Iyer and Meghna Gulzar team up to built a strong sense of emotional play. And this is just what I always expected from a war-torn film. The dynamics of \"Ae Watan\" play in context to both the countries, there's no hero or villain - humanity is. Bollywood has often patronised the term \"patriotism\", Raazi steps beyond it by taking up the humanistic approach brilliantly. And then, the following dialogue works as a paradox- \"Watan Ke Aage Kuch Bhi Nahi, Mohabbat Bhi Nahi (there's nothing beyond a nation, not even love)\", says Iqbal Syed.<br/><br/>Sehmat played by Alia Bhatt carves into emotion during the shower scene, often her anxiety comes across childish which just stands as a mould. Watching the film with a peaceful mind might help to digest the thought properly, and I guess, our nation needs such a thought owing to the present \"nationalist\" agenda.</div>\n",

Vicky Kaushal is one such example .. <br/><br/>Movie brings life to a book titled 'Calling Sehmat' by Harinder S Sikka and never through the entire length would you find a need to go back and read it .. you know what I mean .. it is stitched quite beautifully.

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Among the few gifted directors is the name Meghna Gulzar who has blessed bollywood with a miracle like Talvar where the direction itself is enough to grip you to the movie for few weeks.With same brilliance and spark comes Raazi to question your thoughts over the unsung heroes &amp; their selfless motives to keep India to peace.With showcase of dot to dot performance matched by realistic dialogues helped by strong background score, the movie does set a benchmark for Indo-Pak theme movies.From the opening scene to the last flash of the projector on the screen the story clearly outlines the failed relationship between the neighbouring nations India &amp; Pakistan.\n",
      "Don't be confused Raazi is not a war movie or period drama but is an over the seat thriller with few intense moments that come unexpected.The fast pace of the movie assists in keeping your focus all over the screen.The way the story unfolds layer by layer delights your senses and all you wish is to keep up with ongoing events.\n",
      "What satisfies you the most is the efforts put in by both the lead actors as well as the supporting cast.Alia does justice to the role of an Indian Spy who under family pressure accepts what destiny throws to her and moulds herself to the expectation of her father.Alia has definitely out-performed her capabilities and has set new standards for a female-oriented movie.Vicky Kaushal on the other hand doesn't have much screen time but manages to establish himself as a strong character in the movie,with discipline of a soldier &amp; innocence of a lover he manages to gain your affection.Jaideep Ahlawat is another pillar of the story who completely fits in the shoes of a 'Die for the nation' refugee who serves the country before anything else.\n",
      "Some other positives are the beautiful shoot location of Kashmir &amp; the patriotic songs in the voice of Arijit Singh who connects you emotionally to the story of a young girl burdened under expectations.The silent chemistry between Alia Bhatt &amp; Vicky Kaushal also adds flavor of love to the movie.<br/><br/>Overall if you put Raazi under your judgment it sure delights you in each and every way possible with excellent performances and commendable direction.Go for the movie if you wish to put your respect in the efforts of the non-recognised heroes of our country.</div>\n",

Story and screen play will blow your mind in some of the scenes you would stop breathing and would imagine your self at Sehmat place. In terms of acting its really a performance driven movie which will be remembered for alia's best performances till now and rest of the cast is also amazing everyone has done thier best job. Background and music is also great but i would really appreciate karan johar to invest in such movies like kapoor and sons or raazi. I am happy that karan johar is moving towards quality cinema.

And I can definitely say that this is one of the best of 2018.<br/><br/>Plot: Sehmat is married to Iqbal Syed of the Pakistani army, so that she can pass information about Pakistan's actions against India during 1971.<br/><br/>Story and direction: This film is adapted from the novel 'Calling Sehmat' by Harinder Sikka. This film has been very beautifully adapted by Meghna and Bhavani Iyer. The writing of the film is spot-on and never is it felt that the story was dragging. The character work of this film is also so intricate and detailed that I was in awe. The film not only showed that how spies work but also put light on the fact as to how difficult is a spy's work mentally. This aspect is highlighted most in this venture which was a risk and I salute Meghna and team for taking that risk. Here the Pakistani's are not shown as the enemies but as humans who would do anything to protect their country. The scenery of Kashmir and Pakistan were very well captured. But I did feel that I could guess some scenes. I am thinking that is just me. The character choices seemed very guessable, which was my only flaw with this film.<br/><br/>Performances: Alia Bhatt once again proves that she is a great actress if given a compelling script. From the young college girl to the Indian spy, she played all the roles with ease. Vicky Kaushal was another of the gems of this film. Jaideep Ahlawat was an awesome mentor to Alia's character. Rajit Kapur, Shishir Sharma and Arif Zakaria also provided come great performances.<br/><br/>Songs and BGM: This film has only three songs and all of them are good. Gulzar's lyrics and Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy's music were good. The songs never felt they were there to just fill in gaps. They moved the story forward and provided fuel to such a wonderful story. My favorite was 'Dilbaro'. The BGM felt good to the ears and not irritable as most Indian BGM's sound.<br/><br/>Favorite Scene: It would be the one in the beginning where Hidayat tells Sehmat to return to college and resume her studies. But then Sehmat replies that if her father can serve the nation why not her. The kind of maturity seen in that particular scene is what made an impression on my mind and my favourite.<br/><br/>Verdict: Meghna Gulzar is proving to be one of the compelling female directors of recent times. First Talvar and now Raazi. This film's different take on a spy genre and Alia's performance make this a must watch. <br/><br/>I am going with a 9/10 with this one.</div>\n",

       "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Raazi does what very few Bollywood movies do right. It pulls off a tight script with good acting, and a realistic believable storyline that leaves you on the edge of your seat for two hours. The film also manages to maintain a tight pace while building up towards an impactful climax. In particular, I think three things made it unforgettable: <br/><br/>Firstly, the acting was on point, and made the movie what it turned out to be. Alia Bhatt is turning out to be an absolute genius, and has come a long way from her 'student of the year' days. There are very few in her peer-group that can do justice to these kinds of roles. Vicky Kaushal was good as the beguiled husband, and his restrained yet emotional male character (supporting a powerful female lead) is a Bollywood rarity, and was thoroughly enjoyable. The others are on point too, with minor actors like Jaideep Ahlawat and Rajit Kapoor delivering strong performances. <br/><br/>Secondly, the movie turned out to be tight and on point, with no melodramatic displays of emotion or sappy songs. The good old premises of a bride departing to her husband's household for (presumably) good, the arranged marriage with a virtually unknown man, and eventual marriage consummation were all present, in theory. These are all typically perfect opportunities to inject unnecessary bridal parting songs, lengthy wedding song and dance sequences (boy's side, girl's side, etc.) and the worst of all - a song balancing sleaze with \"Indian culture\" (read: censor board mandated restraint) that plays when the marriage is consummated (this is typically a couple kissing and rolling around in a bed, carefully clothing their privates with velvet or satin sheets). But Raazi eliminates all of this fluff and more, leaving you wishing more movies would do away with the crap in favor of keeping the pace of the plot. <br/><br/>Lastly, and most importantly, Raazi does justice to the complexity of the India-Pakistan conflict. The countries have a shared history which makes the war painfully more unique (e.g. Abdul, the oldest and most faithful caretaker in the Pakistani household is of Indian origin). The movie takes no sides, and shows you that humanity and ruthlessness exist on both sides. This is a significant departure from the patriotic films of yesteryear - we are habituated to seeing a good vs evil theme, and having Pakistanis depicted as soulless warmongers. And so, you are simply not prepared to empathize with Iqbal's (Vicky Kaushal's) gentle persona, and when you do, it his vulnerable humanity hits you like a truck. Conversely, the hardened Indian intelligence agent Mir is many things during the movie, but 'human' he is not. <br/><br/>I walked away from the theater understanding better the nature of such wars, and that the real conflict is not over Kashmir, or between two sides, or between ideologies. The real conflict is always fought within the human heart: between the ruthless imperatives of duty, and the very human urges of gentleness, mercy and love.</div>\n",

       "Set during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, the film concerns an Indian female spy Sehmat married to a Pakistani military man. I haven't read the book but I still thoroughly enjoyed this film.\n",
       "The director did a masterful technique of placing the audience in Sehmat's shoes, the audience is privy to the information as she receives n passes on to the Intelligence bureau. Alia Bhatt as Sehmat did a terrific job n Vicky Kaushal as her husband was an icing on the cake. The scene of the marriage consummation is aptly placed.\n",
       "I am really surprised n happy that for the first time Bollywood hasn't demonized enemy soldiers.\n",
       "It is a slow burner, this is neither an Akshay/Salman/Sunny Deol movie.\n",
       "There are no action sequences or intense shootouts. Most of the film is shot in the house.\n",
       "This is entirely unglamorous, but the film does have an underlying tension n relies on the impending sense of dread which hangs over Sehmat's entire investigation.\n",
       "Ther r two scenes wher Sehmat is almost exposed n the reaction n facial expression of Alia during those two scenes were amazing.\n",

It doesn't have any dance numbers, nor does it have any melodramatic romance. It stays true to what it sets out to do right from the beginning. The lead actor Alia Bhatt manages to get into skin of the character so comfortably that you forget that you are watching a movie, instead you feel the pain she is emoting. <br/><br/>What is brilliant about the film is that you keep expecting that every scene is leading you to a traditional Indo-Pak friendship kind of an ending with a stong social message. But what astonishes here is that the movie manages to remain a BRUTAL story of spy carrying out its mission through out. An out and out hardcore spy thriller with a women protagonist, so beautifully crafted that you are left spellbound. <br/><br/>Meghna Gulzar captures the simplicity of characters with so much depth that you are bound to sympathize with every character. Take a bow!<br/><br/>All actors are at par. Direction is superb. Camera work is crisp. Background score is perfect. This movie is a gem.</div>\n",

This true story itself is something that, I am sure, NO ONE could ever imagine in their wildest dreams!<br/><br/>But here's something that I am sure you will agree with!<br/><br/>Probably, we all would've enjoyed the movie more had we not been aware of the true story, beforehand! The Trailers and Reviews acted as complete spoilsports!<br/><br/>There are 3 main highlights of the film: <br/><br/>1. The story itself which is thriller - with a surprise event towards the end<br/><br/>2. Alia Bhat's acting - which was both, moving &amp; convincing<br/><br/>3. The normal treatment of Pakistani characters (a first-of-its-kind in Hindi cinema)<br/><br/>Is this film worth seeing even a second time? Yes, it is!</div>\n",

       "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Based on an incredible true story, Raazi is a tribute to unknown heroes of our nation in war time zone. Directed by Meghna Gulzar, who had directed extremely well movie- Talvar in past, this film tells a story about a normal and simple Indian girl, and her journey from being a daughter to a wife and to a spy. One more factor is also there, but am not revealing now because you will get it at the end.<br/><br/>Alia Bhatt plays a character of Sehmat, who is an Indian spy married to a Pakistani military officer (Vicky Kaushal) during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 on the order of her father. Would she get success to pass on information from Pakistan to India without getting caught and to help Indian forces to stop the war or fight back to Pakistan.... For that go and watch Raazi.<br/><br/>It is an adaptation of Harinder Sikka's novel 'Calling Sehmat'. Screenplay has been written by Meghna and Bhavani Iyer. Dialogues are written by Meghna. Some dialogues are outstanding. 'Watan Ke Aage Kuch Nahi, Khud Bhi Nahi... Mohabbat Bhi Nahi!' One more is there, when one is declaring about his cancer, he says that- 'Smoking To Ki Nahi Kabhi... Magar Shayad Zindagi ke Kash Thode Lambe Le Liye...!' What a line man! Only a daughter of a great poet can write such!<br/><br/>Alia Bhatt has delivered another award winning performance. Till now in this year, she is the deserving one. First time you will see her crying. Especially, in that scene where she is asking his officer about how to balance between life, emotions and duty in war, because it is the toughest one. VIcky Kaushal is as usaul superb. He has less dialogues, but his silences speak more. The gun scene with Alia is the best scene of these two actors. Jaideep Ahlawat has done commendable job. He is always good. But this time he is on another level. Along with Rajit Kapur and Soni Razdan, rest are good, too.<br/><br/>Lyrics by Gulzar Saheb and Music by Shankar Ehsaan Loy. Dilbaro is pure Kashmiri folk song on the perfect situation of marriage saying- 'Mudke Na Dekho Dilbaro!' Raazi title track is engaging. Whenever Arijit's voice starts in the hall, some magic happens everytime in this film. School annual function song by Sunidhi and the same song in Arijit Singh's voice - 'Ae Watan'- is the best song that Gulzar Saheb can give us in this decade. What a melody man! Looks like a classic old hindi film tune. For the film situated in 1971, this is the best patriotic song one can ever make! I am so proud of this song... 'Main Jahan Rahun Jahaan Mein Yaad Rahe Tu, Ae Watan... Mere Watan!'<br/><br/>I knew that this film would be superb. But this song has uplifted it more. But the same time, it's touching the deepest portion of heart. Human is very complicated creature. Human is not a robot. For anyone, it is hard to be a robot. One can try one's best, but one can't delete the function of emotions from the body. Without emotions, there is no living. Salute to those heroes who are living without emotions so that millions of people from their countries can live happily! <br/><br/>If a girl can go to this level for her father and her nation, what can you or I do at current position! The question is unanswered by me. I am still thinking (while writing as well!) The more I think of it, the more I am getting deeper in the thought. <br/><br/>The story of a courageous girl is definitely a Must Watch. You'll feel proud of such unsung heroes of your country. Feel the emotions of them. Feel the tension of espionage. Feel the heat of war. As they say- In the War, nothing is important than War, neither you, nor me!</div>\n",

       "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">**Minor spoilers**<br/><br/>We often laud our soldiers who have died trying to protect our Nation from enemies.Poems and songs are written.Laurels are given.Deservedly so.However,what about the people who are unnamed(and will probably remain so),but still served a pivotal role in protecting the Nation..and maybe even died doing so? 'Raazi' tells the story of one such character.<br/><br/>Among other things,the central purpose of 'Raazi' is to outline the sacrifices spies make.As one character complaints in a rather vicious manner,\"Na rishton ki qadar hai..Na jaan ki\"(you neither care for relationships nor life) The Nation comes first for these people.So much so,that even some personal relationships need to be sacrificed(atleast in this movie's case) <br/><br/>It is very,very rare to find an Indian movie that doesn't callously demean the 'enemy'.Usually,the audience is just supposed to hate the other side.Our side is always the best and the people involved think the same.Manipulative music,spoon-feeding the audience,cliched dialogues and extremely one-sided narrations usually plague Bollywood's attempts at patriotic movies.'Raazi' steers clear of all these issues.On the contrary,this movie demands an attentive viewing.The viewer is expected to remember certain details.The movie is buoyed by a taut screenplay and a brilliant central performance.Interestingly,this movie respects the patriotism on both sides.Neither side is made out to be a villain or a Hero.All characters are trying to do what's best for their country(ies)<br/><br/>\n",
       "I am delighted that such a movie has come out of India.There are some minor plot holes,but they don't affect the movie in any important way.Kudos to Meghna Gulzar for trusting the audience with such a screenplay and Kudos for bringing such a story to the public.<br/><br/>P.S.: There is something for Breaking Bad fans here too.I also got Homeland vibes from some scenes.</div>\n",

       "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Had the second half of the movie been executed a bit more efficiently, this could've have been an outstanding spy movie from bollywood, after a very long time. The movie takes us into the life of a 20 year old college going girl, Sehmat. The story revolves around the Indo-Pak war of 1971 from a perspective unknown to the common man. How suddenly things fall apart and this young girl's life changes drastically with choices beyond her reach is what unfolds in the movie. \n",
       "THE BACKGROUND SCORE &amp; MUSIC\n",
       "The trio of Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy yet again pulls off a musical treat. The background score is aptly fitted. Every scene is filled to it's highest thrill with just the perfect blend of music and songs. Though the songs haven't been in the buzz much yet when it reflects in the movie, it just seem a pretty decent job.\n",
       "SCREENPLAY &amp; DIALOGUES\n",
       "The writing duo here of Meghna-Bhavani, seems almost flawless and picture perfect in the first half. The story is in just the fine pace, with sufficient fillers to fill in. The dialogues are written very well by Meghna gulzar. She has adapted the urdu language very efficiently in the dialogues, keeping in mind the audience and their ability to interpret. \n",
       "With the second half, the narrative slightly looses it's track. It fails to maintain that grip over the audience. As we descend towards the climax, I even felt like it started to slightly diverge from its abstraction.\n",
       "CINEMATOGRAPHY\n",
       "The era of 70's has been showed pretty decently in the movie. Jay patel doesn't disappoints with his work. His shots and perspective of some intense scenes were really an asset to the movie. There are few close up shots, if I knew any better, still I'll admit to this fact that those shots completely changes the momentum of the impact of the scene over the audience. Capturing many low light scenes with such mastery, this man has done his job very profoundly. \n",
       "ACTING \n",
       "If I be very honest then this section absolutely grabs a full star. Alia Bhatt has yet again proved her worth in the industry, she's far more than just a cute face! Her acting is simply an excellence. She is so mesmerizing to watch that a lack of a male lead and the fact that this is a female centric becomes completely oblivious, if it at all is a bother to anyone in the very first place. A huge salute to the casting director Jogi. His works reflects effortlessly on the screen, with every actor fitting just so fine in their given character's shoes and also delivering it with so much conviction.\n",
       "Vicky kaushal, Arif Zakaria and Shishir Sharma are exceptional on screen, their work is truly outstanding. Special mention to Rajit Kapoor, having so less a screen time yet managed to leave a hard impact. Truly exceptional.\n",
       "After 'Talvar' (2015), I really liked Meghna's work. She really knows her way around the script, she knows how to and when to play what. Yet it was hurtful to see the second half slipping out like that. Nevertheless it's a brilliant work by her in bringing the world of sehmat alive on screen. It's definitely a must watch if you are a person with high patriotism and/or a great fan of Alia Bhatt.\n",

       "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Until the interval, the film was slowly boiling but felt like something was missing. But a powerful scene just before the interval explained the whole film in a go. Sehmat undresses herself after a killing, stands under the shower and cries - the cries crack up the heart. One surrenders to the nation irrespective of the in-depth emotions, until Raazi came up the films relied more on nation. But, Meghna Gulzar proves, Emotion is greater than Nation.<br/><br/>The complex nature of the film might come across as a defect, beneath the surface the heart is rapidly beating and the conflicts underline every character. The borders cease to exist, writers Bhavani Iyer and Meghna Gulzar team up to built a strong sense of emotional play. And this is just what I always expected from a war-torn film. The dynamics of \"Ae Watan\" play in context to both the countries, there's no hero or villain - humanity is. Bollywood has often patronised the term \"patriotism\", Raazi steps beyond it by taking up the humanistic approach brilliantly. And then, the following dialogue works as a paradox- \"Watan Ke Aage Kuch Bhi Nahi, Mohabbat Bhi Nahi (there's nothing beyond a nation, not even love)\", says Iqbal Syed.<br/><br/>Sehmat played by Alia Bhatt carves into emotion during the shower scene, often her anxiety comes across childish which just stands as a mould. Watching the film with a peaceful mind might help to digest the thought properly, and I guess, our nation needs such a thought owing to the present \"nationalist\" agenda.</div>\n",

       "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Among the few gifted directors is the name Meghna Gulzar who has blessed bollywood with a miracle like Talvar where the direction itself is enough to grip you to the movie for few weeks.With same brilliance and spark comes Raazi to question your thoughts over the unsung heroes &amp; their selfless motives to keep India to peace.With showcase of dot to dot performance matched by realistic dialogues helped by strong background score, the movie does set a benchmark for Indo-Pak theme movies.From the opening scene to the last flash of the projector on the screen the story clearly outlines the failed relationship between the neighbouring nations India &amp; Pakistan.\n",
       "Don't be confused Raazi is not a war movie or period drama but is an over the seat thriller with few intense moments that come unexpected.The fast pace of the movie assists in keeping your focus all over the screen.The way the story unfolds layer by layer delights your senses and all you wish is to keep up with ongoing events.\n",
       "What satisfies you the most is the efforts put in by both the lead actors as well as the supporting cast.Alia does justice to the role of an Indian Spy who under family pressure accepts what destiny throws to her and moulds herself to the expectation of her father.Alia has definitely out-performed her capabilities and has set new standards for a female-oriented movie.Vicky Kaushal on the other hand doesn't have much screen time but manages to establish himself as a strong character in the movie,with discipline of a soldier &amp; innocence of a lover he manages to gain your affection.Jaideep Ahlawat is another pillar of the story who completely fits in the shoes of a 'Die for the nation' refugee who serves the country before anything else.\n",
       "Some other positives are the beautiful shoot location of Kashmir &amp; the patriotic songs in the voice of Arijit Singh who connects you emotionally to the story of a young girl burdened under expectations.The silent chemistry between Alia Bhatt &amp; Vicky Kaushal also adds flavor of love to the movie.<br/><br/>Overall if you put Raazi under your judgment it sure delights you in each and every way possible with excellent performances and commendable direction.Go for the movie if you wish to put your respect in the efforts of the non-recognised heroes of our country.</div>\n",

Story and screen play will blow your mind in some of the scenes you would stop breathing and would imagine your self at Sehmat place. In terms of acting its really a performance driven movie which will be remembered for alia's best performances till now and rest of the cast is also amazing everyone has done thier best job. Background and music is also great but i would really appreciate karan johar to invest in such movies like kapoor and sons or raazi. I am happy that karan johar is moving towards quality cinema. Must watch.</div>\n",

       "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Raazi is a film co-written and directed by Meghna Gulzar. The trailers seemed good to me and the ongoing positive reception, both, critically and commercially, compelled me to watch this film. And I can definitely say that this is one of the best of 2018.<br/><br/>Plot: Sehmat is married to Iqbal Syed of the Pakistani army, so that she can pass information about Pakistan's actions against India during 1971.<br/><br/>Story and direction: This film is adapted from the novel 'Calling Sehmat' by Harinder Sikka. This film has been very beautifully adapted by Meghna and Bhavani Iyer. The writing of the film is spot-on and never is it felt that the story was dragging. The character work of this film is also so intricate and detailed that I was in awe. The film not only showed that how spies work but also put light on the fact as to how difficult is a spy's work mentally. This aspect is highlighted most in this venture which was a risk and I salute Meghna and team for taking that risk. Here the Pakistani's are not shown as the enemies but as humans who would do anything to protect their country. The scenery of Kashmir and Pakistan were very well captured. But I did feel that I could guess some scenes. I am thinking that is just me. The character choices seemed very guessable, which was my only flaw with this film.<br/><br/>Performances: Alia Bhatt once again proves that she is a great actress if given a compelling script. From the young college girl to the Indian spy, she played all the roles with ease. Vicky Kaushal was another of the gems of this film. Jaideep Ahlawat was an awesome mentor to Alia's character. Rajit Kapur, Shishir Sharma and Arif Zakaria also provided come great performances.<br/><br/>Songs and BGM: This film has only three songs and all of them are good. Gulzar's lyrics and Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy's music were good. The songs never felt they were there to just fill in gaps. They moved the story forward and provided fuel to such a wonderful story. My favorite was 'Dilbaro'. The BGM felt good to the ears and not irritable as most Indian BGM's sound.<br/><br/>Favorite Scene: It would be the one in the beginning where Hidayat tells Sehmat to return to college and resume her studies. But then Sehmat replies that if her father can serve the nation why not her. The kind of maturity seen in that particular scene is what made an impression on my mind and my favourite.<br/><br/>Verdict: Meghna Gulzar is proving to be one of the compelling female directors of recent times. First Talvar and now Raazi. This film's different take on a spy genre and Alia's performance make this a must watch. <br/><br/>I am going with a 9/10 with this one.</div>\n",

       "Alia Bhatt : She portrays Sehmat Khan. Alia is confident in her role. Sehmat represents a character who is brave and equally helpless and she performs this flawlessly, definitely one of Bollywood's most dedicated actress.\n",
       "Vicky Kaushal : He portrays Iqbal Syed, Sehmat's Pakistani husband. Vicky performed well with the limited screen space, he complemented Alia in every way. \n",
       "Rajit Kapoor who plays Hidayat Khan, Shishir Sharma who plays Brigadier Syed, and Jaideep Ahlawad who plays Khalid Mir were all vital supporting actors. <br/><br/>PLOT\n",
       "The story of Raazi is about an Indian girl who marries into a Pakistan army family in order to spy on them during the India - Pakistan war in 1971. The script is based on a book titled 'Calling Sehmat' by Harinder S Sikka, and it keeps you gripped thru out it's length. Director Meghna Gulzar, writes and directs beautifully. <br/><br/>SOUNDTRACK\n",
       "The tracks of Raazi are deep, meaningful and bring in that patriotic feel. \n",
       "Favorite track : Ae Watan. <br/><br/>Overall Raazi is spy thriller which is not to be missed. It's definitely a winner for Dharma Productions and Junglee Pictures.</div>\n",

It pulls off a tight script with good acting, and a realistic believable storyline that leaves you on the edge of your seat for two hours. The film also manages to maintain a tight pace while building up towards an impactful climax. In particular, I think three things made it unforgettable: Firstly, the acting was on point, and made the movie what it turned out to be. Alia Bhatt is turning out to be an absolute genius, and has come a long way from her \\'student of the year\\' days. There are very few in her peer-group that can do justice to these kinds of roles. Vicky Kaushal was good as the beguiled husband, and his restrained yet emotional male character (supporting a powerful female lead) is a Bollywood rarity, and was thoroughly enjoyable. The others are on point too, with minor actors like Jaideep Ahlawat and Rajit Kapoor delivering strong performances. Secondly, the movie turned out to be tight and on point, with no melodramatic displays of emotion or sappy songs. The good old premises of a bride departing to her husband\\'s household for (presumably) good, the arranged marriage with a virtually unknown man, and eventual marriage consummation were all present, in theory. These are all typically perfect opportunities to inject unnecessary bridal parting songs, lengthy wedding song and dance sequences (boy\\'s side, girl\\'s side, etc.) and the worst of all - a song balancing sleaze with \"Indian culture\" (read: censor board mandated restraint) that plays when the marriage is consummated (this is typically a couple kissing and rolling around in a bed, carefully clothing their privates with velvet or satin sheets). But Raazi eliminates all of this fluff and more, leaving you wishing more movies would do away with the crap in favor of keeping the pace of the plot. Lastly, and most importantly, Raazi does justice to the complexity of the India-Pakistan conflict. The countries have a shared history which makes the war painfully more unique (e.g. Abdul, the oldest and most faithful caretaker in the Pakistani household is of Indian origin). The movie takes no sides, and shows you that humanity and ruthlessness exist on both sides. This is a significant departure from the patriotic films of yesteryear - we are habituated to seeing a good vs evil theme, and having Pakistanis depicted as soulless warmongers. And so, you are simply not prepared to empathize with Iqbal\\'s (Vicky Kaushal\\'s) gentle persona, and when you do, it his vulnerable humanity hits you like a truck. Conversely, the hardened Indian intelligence agent Mir is many things during the movie, but \\'human\\' he is not. I walked away from the theater understanding better the nature of such wars, and that the real conflict is not over Kashmir, or between two sides, or between ideologies. The real conflict is always fought within the human heart: between the ruthless imperatives of duty, and the very human urges of gentleness, mercy and love.\\n\\n                    61 out of 70 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

I haven\\'t read the book but I still thoroughly enjoyed this film.\\nThe director did a masterful technique of placing the audience in Sehmat\\'s shoes, the audience is privy to the information as she receives n passes on to the Intelligence bureau. Alia Bhatt as Sehmat did a terrific job n Vicky Kaushal as her husband was an icing on the cake. The scene of the marriage consummation is aptly placed.\\nI am really surprised n happy that for the first time Bollywood hasn\\'t demonized enemy soldiers.\\nIt is a slow burner, this is neither an Akshay/Salman/Sunny Deol movie.\\nThere are no action sequences or intense shootouts. Most of the film is shot in the house.\\nThis is entirely unglamorous, but the film does have an underlying tension n relies on the impending sense of dread which hangs over Sehmat\\'s entire investigation.\\nTher r two scenes wher Sehmat is almost exposed n the reaction n facial expression of Alia during those two scenes were amazing.\\nMy only cribbing is why on earth the servant has to run or keep on running rather than alarm other people. Nevertheless a very solid n different Indian spy thriller.\\nHappy Ramadan.

Bollywood at its best.\\n \\ngbhuvnesh24 July 2018\\n\\n\\nA great movie! What\\'s surprising is, Raazi doesn\\'t dwell into traditional bollywood subplots. It doesn\\'t have any dance numbers, nor does it have any melodramatic romance. It stays true to what it sets out to do right from the beginning. The lead actor Alia Bhatt manages to get into skin of the character so comfortably that you forget that you are watching a movie, instead you feel the pain she is emoting. What is brilliant about the film is that you keep expecting that every scene is leading you to a traditional Indo-Pak friendship kind of an ending with a stong social message. But what astonishes here is that the movie manages to remain a BRUTAL story of spy carrying out its mission through out. An out and out hardcore spy thriller with a women protagonist, so beautifully crafted that you are left spellbound. Meghna Gulzar captures the simplicity of characters with so much depth that you are bound to sympathize with every character. Take a bow!All actors are at par. Direction is superb. Camera work is crisp. Background score is perfect. This movie is a gem.\\n\\n                    16 out of 20 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

It is based on a true story and director Meghana Gulzar does an excellent job of portraying the patriotism of Sehmat in the film.

The Trailers and Reviews acted as complete spoilsports!There are 3 main highlights of the film: 1. The story itself which is thriller - with a surprise event towards the end2. Alia Bhat\\'s acting - which was both, moving & convincing3. The normal treatment of Pakistani characters (a first-of-its-kind in Hindi cinema)Is this film worth seeing even a second time?

(Ae Watan song is superb!)\\n \\nmaulin511 May 2018\\n\\n\\nBased on an incredible true story, Raazi is a tribute to unknown heroes of our nation in war time zone. Directed by Meghna Gulzar, who had directed extremely well movie- Talvar in past, this film tells a story about a normal and simple Indian girl, and her journey from being a daughter to a wife and to a spy. One more factor is also there, but am not revealing now because you will get it at the end.Alia Bhatt plays a character of Sehmat, who is an Indian spy married to a Pakistani military officer (Vicky Kaushal) during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 on the order of her father. Would she get success to pass on information from Pakistan to India without getting caught and to help Indian forces to stop the war or fight back to Pakistan.... For that go and watch Raazi.It is an adaptation of Harinder Sikka\\'s novel \\'Calling Sehmat\\'. Screenplay has been written by Meghna and Bhavani Iyer. Dialogues are written by Meghna. Some dialogues are outstanding. \\'Watan Ke Aage Kuch Nahi, Khud Bhi Nahi... Mohabbat Bhi Nahi!\\' One more is there, when one is declaring about his cancer, he says that- \\'Smoking To Ki Nahi Kabhi... Magar Shayad Zindagi ke Kash Thode Lambe Le Liye...!\\' What a line man! Only a daughter of a great poet can write such!Alia Bhatt has delivered another award winning performance. Till now in this year, she is the deserving one. First time you will see her crying. Especially, in that scene where she is asking his officer about how to balance between life, emotions and duty in war, because it is the toughest one. VIcky Kaushal is as usaul superb. He has less dialogues, but his silences speak more. The gun scene with Alia is the best scene of these two actors. Jaideep Ahlawat has done commendable job. He is always good. But this time he is on another level. Along with Rajit Kapur and Soni Razdan, rest are good, too.Lyrics by Gulzar Saheb and Music by Shankar Ehsaan Loy. Dilbaro is pure Kashmiri folk song on the perfect situation of marriage saying- \\'Mudke Na Dekho Dilbaro!\\' Raazi title track is engaging. Whenever Arijit\\'s voice starts in the hall, some magic happens everytime in this film. School annual function song by Sunidhi and the same song in Arijit Singh\\'s voice - \\'Ae Watan\\'- is the best song that Gulzar Saheb can give us in this decade. What a melody man! Looks like a classic old hindi film tune. For the film situated in 1971, this is the best patriotic song one can ever make! I am so proud of this song... \\'Main Jahan Rahun Jahaan Mein Yaad Rahe Tu, Ae Watan... Mere Watan!\\'I knew that this film would be superb. But this song has uplifted it more. But the same time, it\\'s touching the deepest portion of heart. Human is very complicated creature. Human is not a robot. For anyone, it is hard to be a robot. One can try one\\'s best, but one can\\'t delete the function of emotions from the body. Without emotions, there is no living. Salute to those heroes who are living without emotions so that millions of people from their countries can live happily! If a girl can go to this level for her father and her nation, what can you or I do at current position! The question is unanswered by me. I am still thinking (while writing as well!) The more I think of it, the more I am getting deeper in the thought. The story of a courageous girl is definitely a Must Watch. You\\'ll feel proud of such unsung heroes of your country. Feel the emotions of them. Feel the tension of espionage. Feel the heat of war. As they say- In the War, nothing is important than War, neither you, nor me!\\n\\n                    23 out of 39 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

Bollywood.\\n \\nrobu-8401412 May 2018\\n\\n\\nHad the second half of the movie been executed a bit more efficiently, this could\\'ve have been an outstanding spy movie from bollywood, after a very long time. The movie takes us into the life of a 20 year old college going girl, Sehmat. The story revolves around the Indo-Pak war of 1971 from a perspective unknown to the common man. How suddenly things fall apart and this young girl\\'s life changes drastically with choices beyond her reach is what unfolds in the movie. \\nTHE BACKGROUND SCORE & MUSIC\\nThe trio of Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy yet again pulls off a musical treat. The background score is aptly fitted. Every scene is filled to it\\'s highest thrill with just the perfect blend of music and songs. Though the songs haven\\'t been in the buzz much yet when it reflects in the movie, it just seem a pretty decent job.\\nSCREENPLAY & DIALOGUES\\nThe writing duo here of Meghna-Bhavani, seems almost flawless and picture perfect in the first half. The story is in just the fine pace, with sufficient fillers to fill in. The dialogues are written very well by Meghna gulzar. She has adapted the urdu language very efficiently in the dialogues, keeping in mind the audience and their ability to interpret. \\nWith the second half, the narrative slightly looses it\\'s track. It fails to maintain that grip over the audience. As we descend towards the climax, I even felt like it started to slightly diverge from its abstraction.\\nCINEMATOGRAPHY\\nThe era of 70\\'s has been showed pretty decently in the movie. Jay patel doesn\\'t disappoints with his work. His shots and perspective of some intense scenes were really an asset to the movie. There are few close up shots, if I knew any better, still I\\'ll admit to this fact that those shots completely changes the momentum of the impact of the scene over the audience. Capturing many low light scenes with such mastery, this man has done his job very profoundly. \\nACTING \\nIf I be very honest then this section absolutely grabs a full star. Alia Bhatt has yet again proved her worth in the industry, she\\'s far more than just a cute face! Her acting is simply an excellence. She is so mesmerizing to watch that a lack of a male lead and the fact that this is a female centric becomes completely oblivious, if it at all is a bother to anyone in the very first place. A huge salute to the casting director Jogi. His works reflects effortlessly on the screen, with every actor fitting just so fine in their given character\\'s shoes and also delivering it with so much conviction.\\nVicky kaushal, Arif Zakaria and Shishir Sharma are exceptional on screen, their work is truly outstanding. Special mention to Rajit Kapoor, having so less a screen time yet managed to leave a hard impact. Truly exceptional.\\nAfter \\'Talvar\\' (2015), I really liked Meghna\\'s work. She really knows her way around the script, she knows how to and when to play what. Yet it was hurtful to see the second half slipping out like that. Nevertheless it\\'s a brilliant work by her in bringing the world of sehmat alive on screen. It\\'s definitely a must watch if you are a person with high patriotism and/or a great fan of Alia Bhatt.\\n(Also check out \\'movifeed\\' on instagram.)\\nThis from me is a One Time Watch.\\n\\n                    13 out of 21 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

But a powerful scene just before the interval explained the whole film in a go. Sehmat undresses herself after a killing, stands under the shower and cries - the cries crack up the heart. One surrenders to the nation irrespective of the in-depth emotions, until Raazi came up the films relied more on nation. But, Meghna Gulzar proves, Emotion is greater than Nation.The complex nature of the film might come across as a defect, beneath the surface the heart is rapidly beating and the conflicts underline every character. The borders cease to exist, writers Bhavani Iyer and Meghna Gulzar team up to built a strong sense of emotional play. And this is just what I always expected from a war-torn film. The dynamics of \"Ae Watan\" play in context to both the countries, there\\'s no hero or villain - humanity is. Bollywood has often patronised the term \"patriotism\", Raazi steps beyond it by taking up the humanistic approach brilliantly. And then, the following dialogue works as a paradox- \"Watan Ke Aage Kuch Bhi Nahi, Mohabbat Bhi Nahi (there\\'s nothing beyond a nation, not even love)\", says Iqbal Syed.Sehmat played by Alia Bhatt carves into emotion during the shower scene, often her anxiety comes across childish which just stands as a mould. Watching the film with a peaceful mind might help to digest the thought properly, and I guess, our nation needs such a thought owing to the present \"nationalist\" agenda.\\n\\n                    11 out of 18 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

In 1971, The war was between Bangladesh-Pakistan. They represent it in wrong way. I could have rated it higher but the information they provide is wrong and misleads the audience.\\n\\n                    17 out of 33 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

It is clear that the director has rushed the film towards the end! A 3 out of 10, not because the film was that bad but because it was shown and promoted as a blockbuster while it is not even remotely near to being a hit.\\n\\n                    11 out of 25 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

There are hardly any loose ends. The director thought of all possible angles. For example, when Zehmat (Alia Bhatt) stumbles while planting evidence against Abdul, it ties back later when her husband finds evidence against her. \\nThe general atmosphere and 70s era is captured very well.

Vicky Kaushal is one such example .. Movie brings life to a book titled \\'Calling Sehmat\\' by Harinder S Sikka and never through the entire length would you find a need to go back and read it .. you know what I mean .. it is stitched quite beautifully. I did not notice any gaps in there.Would not want to add any more details as they tend to become spoilers more often than not .. but Raazi should be certainly given some of your time, in a theater.\\nThis is the best way to appreciate a good movie.And yeah .. we have got a new independence day song .. badly needed and is a good one after a long long time :)\\n\\n                    7 out of 16 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

Story and screen play will blow your mind in some of the scenes you would stop breathing and would imagine your self at Sehmat place. In terms of acting its really a performance driven movie which will be remembered for alia\\'s best performances till now and rest of the cast is also amazing everyone has done thier best job. Background and music is also great but i would really appreciate karan johar to invest in such movies like kapoor and sons or raazi. I am happy that karan johar is moving towards quality cinema.

The trailers seemed good to me and the ongoing positive reception, both, critically and commercially, compelled me to watch this film. And I can definitely say that this is one of the best of 2018.Plot: Sehmat is married to Iqbal Syed of the Pakistani army, so that she can pass information about Pakistan\\'s actions against India during 1971.Story and direction: This film is adapted from the novel \\'Calling Sehmat\\' by Harinder Sikka. This film has been very beautifully adapted by Meghna and Bhavani Iyer. The writing of the film is spot-on and never is it felt that the story was dragging. The character work of this film is also so intricate and detailed that I was in awe. The film not only showed that how spies work but also put light on the fact as to how difficult is a spy\\'s work mentally. This aspect is highlighted most in this venture which was a risk and I salute Meghna and team for taking that risk. Here the Pakistani\\'s are not shown as the enemies but as humans who would do anything to protect their country. The scenery of Kashmir and Pakistan were very well captured. But I did feel that I could guess some scenes. I am thinking that is just me. The character choices seemed very guessable, which was my only flaw with this film.Performances: Alia Bhatt once again proves that she is a great actress if given a compelling script. From the young college girl to the Indian spy, she played all the roles with ease. Vicky Kaushal was another of the gems of this film. Jaideep Ahlawat was an awesome mentor to Alia\\'s character. Rajit Kapur, Shishir Sharma and Arif Zakaria also provided come great performances.Songs and BGM: This film has only three songs and all of them are good. Gulzar\\'s lyrics and Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy\\'s music were good. The songs never felt they were there to just fill in gaps. They moved the story forward and provided fuel to such a wonderful story. My favorite was \\'Dilbaro\\'. The BGM felt good to the ears and not irritable as most Indian BGM\\'s sound.Favorite Scene: It would be the one in the beginning where Hidayat tells Sehmat to return to college and resume her studies. But then Sehmat replies that if her father can serve the nation why not her. The kind of maturity seen in that particular scene is what made an impression on my mind and my favourite.Verdict: Meghna Gulzar is proving to be one of the compelling female directors of recent times. First Talvar and now Raazi. This film\\'s different take on a spy genre and Alia\\'s performance make this a must watch. I am going with a 9/10 with this one.\\n\\n                    3 out of 6 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

Alia is confident in her role. Sehmat represents a character who is brave and equally helpless and she performs this flawlessly, definitely one of Bollywood\\'s most dedicated actress.\\nVicky Kaushal : He portrays Iqbal Syed, Sehmat\\'s Pakistani husband. Vicky performed well with the limited screen space, he complemented Alia in every way. \\nRajit Kapoor who plays Hidayat Khan, Shishir Sharma who plays Brigadier Syed, and Jaideep Ahlawad who plays Khalid Mir were all vital supporting actors. PLOT\\nThe story of Raazi is about an Indian girl who marries into a Pakistan army family in order to spy on them during the India - Pakistan war in 1971. The script is based on a book titled \\'Calling Sehmat\\' by Harinder S Sikka, and it keeps you gripped thru out it\\'s length. Director Meghna Gulzar, writes and directs beautifully. SOUNDTRACK\\nThe tracks of Raazi are deep, meaningful and bring in that patriotic feel. \\nFavorite track : Ae Watan. Overall Raazi is spy thriller which is not to be missed. It\\'s definitely a winner for Dharma Productions and Junglee Pictures.\\n\\n                    5 out of 14 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

      "Raazi does what very few Bollywood movies do right. It pulls off a tight script with good acting, and a realistic believable storyline that leaves you on the edge of your seat for two hours. The film also manages to maintain a tight pace while building up towards an impactful climax. In particular, I think three things made it unforgettable: Firstly, the acting was on point, and made the movie what it turned out to be. Alia Bhatt is turning out to be an absolute genius, and has come a long way from her 'student of the year' days. There are very few in her peer-group that can do justice to these kinds of roles. Vicky Kaushal was good as the beguiled husband, and his restrained yet emotional male character (supporting a powerful female lead) is a Bollywood rarity, and was thoroughly enjoyable. The others are on point too, with minor actors like Jaideep Ahlawat and Rajit Kapoor delivering strong performances. Secondly, the movie turned out to be tight and on point, with no melodramatic displays of emotion or sappy songs. The good old premises of a bride departing to her husband's household for (presumably) good, the arranged marriage with a virtually unknown man, and eventual marriage consummation were all present, in theory. These are all typically perfect opportunities to inject unnecessary bridal parting songs, lengthy wedding song and dance sequences (boy's side, girl's side, etc.) and the worst of all - a song balancing sleaze with \"Indian culture\" (read: censor board mandated restraint) that plays when the marriage is consummated (this is typically a couple kissing and rolling around in a bed, carefully clothing their privates with velvet or satin sheets). But Raazi eliminates all of this fluff and more, leaving you wishing more movies would do away with the crap in favor of keeping the pace of the plot. Lastly, and most importantly, Raazi does justice to the complexity of the India-Pakistan conflict. The countries have a shared history which makes the war painfully more unique (e.g. Abdul, the oldest and most faithful caretaker in the Pakistani household is of Indian origin). The movie takes no sides, and shows you that humanity and ruthlessness exist on both sides. This is a significant departure from the patriotic films of yesteryear - we are habituated to seeing a good vs evil theme, and having Pakistanis depicted as soulless warmongers. And so, you are simply not prepared to empathize with Iqbal's (Vicky Kaushal's) gentle persona, and when you do, it his vulnerable humanity hits you like a truck. Conversely, the hardened Indian intelligence agent Mir is many things during the movie, but 'human' he is not. I walked away from the theater understanding better the nature of such wars, and that the real conflict is not over Kashmir, or between two sides, or between ideologies. The real conflict is always fought within the human heart: between the ruthless imperatives of duty, and the very human urges of gentleness, mercy and love.\n",
      "This is how Indian movies shud be made without the usual bollywood nonsense. \n",
      "Set during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, the film concerns an Indian female spy Sehmat married to a Pakistani military man. I haven't read the book but I still thoroughly enjoyed this film.\n",
      "The director did a masterful technique of placing the audience in Sehmat's shoes, the audience is privy to the information as she receives n passes on to the Intelligence bureau. Alia Bhatt as Sehmat did a terrific job n Vicky Kaushal as her husband was an icing on the cake. The scene of the marriage consummation is aptly placed.\n",
      "I am really surprised n happy that for the first time Bollywood hasn't demonized enemy soldiers.\n",
      "It is a slow burner, this is neither an Akshay/Salman/Sunny Deol movie.\n",
      "There are no action sequences or intense shootouts. Most of the film is shot in the house.\n",
      "This is entirely unglamorous, but the film does have an underlying tension n relies on the impending sense of dread which hangs over Sehmat's entire investigation.\n",
      "Ther r two scenes wher Sehmat is almost exposed n the reaction n facial expression of Alia during those two scenes were amazing.\n",
      "My only cribbing is why on earth the servant has to run or keep on running rather than alarm other people. Nevertheless a very solid n different Indian spy thriller.\n",
      "Happy Ramadan. Fasting is anti cancer.\n",
      "A great movie! What's surprising is, Raazi doesn't dwell into traditional bollywood subplots. It doesn't have any dance numbers, nor does it have any melodramatic romance. It stays true to what it sets out to do right from the beginning. The lead actor Alia Bhatt manages to get into skin of the character so comfortably that you forget that you are watching a movie, instead you feel the pain she is emoting. What is brilliant about the film is that you keep expecting that every scene is leading you to a traditional Indo-Pak friendship kind of an ending with a stong social message. But what astonishes here is that the movie manages to remain a BRUTAL story of spy carrying out its mission through out. An out and out hardcore spy thriller with a women protagonist, so beautifully crafted that you are left spellbound. Meghna Gulzar captures the simplicity of characters with so much depth that you are bound to sympathize with every character. Take a bow!All actors are at par. Direction is superb. Camera work is crisp. Background score is perfect. This movie is a gem.\n",
      "The film starts with a subtle introduction of 20 years old Sehmat who eventually makes the entire storyline. It is based on a true story and director Meghana Gulzar does an excellent job of portraying the patriotism of Sehmat in the film. The film also depicts the part of humanity in patriotism.\n",
      "Alia and vikcky have prefectly got their character in the film and does a wonderful job! Very thrilling and motivational!\n",
      "Raazi is one-of-a-kind spy thriller! What is more surprising is that it is based on a true story (although in a dramatized form)! This true story itself is something that, I am sure, NO ONE could ever imagine in their wildest dreams!But here's something that I am sure you will agree with!Probably, we all would've enjoyed the movie more had we not been aware of the true story, beforehand! The Trailers and Reviews acted as complete spoilsports!There are 3 main highlights of the film: 1. The story itself which is thriller - with a surprise event towards the end2. Alia Bhat's acting - which was both, moving & convincing3. The normal treatment of Pakistani characters (a first-of-its-kind in Hindi cinema)Is this film worth seeing even a second time? Yes, it is!\n",
      "Based on an incredible true story, Raazi is a tribute to unknown heroes of our nation in war time zone. Directed by Meghna Gulzar, who had directed extremely well movie- Talvar in past, this film tells a story about a normal and simple Indian girl, and her journey from being a daughter to a wife and to a spy. One more factor is also there, but am not revealing now because you will get it at the end.Alia Bhatt plays a character of Sehmat, who is an Indian spy married to a Pakistani military officer (Vicky Kaushal) during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 on the order of her father. Would she get success to pass on information from Pakistan to India without getting caught and to help Indian forces to stop the war or fight back to Pakistan.... For that go and watch Raazi.It is an adaptation of Harinder Sikka's novel 'Calling Sehmat'. Screenplay has been written by Meghna and Bhavani Iyer. Dialogues are written by Meghna. Some dialogues are outstanding. 'Watan Ke Aage Kuch Nahi, Khud Bhi Nahi... Mohabbat Bhi Nahi!' One more is there, when one is declaring about his cancer, he says that- 'Smoking To Ki Nahi Kabhi... Magar Shayad Zindagi ke Kash Thode Lambe Le Liye...!' What a line man! Only a daughter of a great poet can write such!Alia Bhatt has delivered another award winning performance. Till now in this year, she is the deserving one. First time you will see her crying. Especially, in that scene where she is asking his officer about how to balance between life, emotions and duty in war, because it is the toughest one. VIcky Kaushal is as usaul superb. He has less dialogues, but his silences speak more. The gun scene with Alia is the best scene of these two actors. Jaideep Ahlawat has done commendable job. He is always good. But this time he is on another level. Along with Rajit Kapur and Soni Razdan, rest are good, too.Lyrics by Gulzar Saheb and Music by Shankar Ehsaan Loy. Dilbaro is pure Kashmiri folk song on the perfect situation of marriage saying- 'Mudke Na Dekho Dilbaro!' Raazi title track is engaging. Whenever Arijit's voice starts in the hall, some magic happens everytime in this film. School annual function song by Sunidhi and the same song in Arijit Singh's voice - 'Ae Watan'- is the best song that Gulzar Saheb can give us in this decade. What a melody man! Looks like a classic old hindi film tune. For the film situated in 1971, this is the best patriotic song one can ever make! I am so proud of this song... 'Main Jahan Rahun Jahaan Mein Yaad Rahe Tu, Ae Watan... Mere Watan!'I knew that this film would be superb. But this song has uplifted it more. But the same time, it's touching the deepest portion of heart. Human is very complicated creature. Human is not a robot. For anyone, it is hard to be a robot. One can try one's best, but one can't delete the function of emotions from the body. Without emotions, there is no living. Salute to those heroes who are living without emotions so that millions of people from their countries can live happily! If a girl can go to this level for her father and her nation, what can you or I do at current position! The question is unanswered by me. I am still thinking (while writing as well!) The more I think of it, the more I am getting deeper in the thought. The story of a courageous girl is definitely a Must Watch. You'll feel proud of such unsung heroes of your country. Feel the emotions of them. Feel the tension of espionage. Feel the heat of war. As they say- In the War, nothing is important than War, neither you, nor me!\n",
      "**Minor spoilers**We often laud our soldiers who have died trying to protect our Nation from enemies.Poems and songs are written.Laurels are given.Deservedly so.However,what about the people who are unnamed(and will probably remain so),but still served a pivotal role in protecting the Nation..and maybe even died doing so? 'Raazi' tells the story of one such character.Among other things,the central purpose of 'Raazi' is to outline the sacrifices spies make.As one character complaints in a rather vicious manner,\"Na rishton ki qadar hai..Na jaan ki\"(you neither care for relationships nor life) The Nation comes first for these people.So much so,that even some personal relationships need to be sacrificed(atleast in this movie's case) It is very,very rare to find an Indian movie that doesn't callously demean the 'enemy'.Usually,the audience is just supposed to hate the other side.Our side is always the best and the people involved think the same.Manipulative music,spoon-feeding the audience,cliched dialogues and extremely one-sided narrations usually plague Bollywood's attempts at patriotic movies.'Raazi' steers clear of all these issues.On the contrary,this movie demands an attentive viewing.The viewer is expected to remember certain details.The movie is buoyed by a taut screenplay and a brilliant central performance.Interestingly,this movie respects the patriotism on both sides.Neither side is made out to be a villain or a Hero.All characters are trying to do what's best for their country(ies)\n",
      "I am delighted that such a movie has come out of India.There are some minor plot holes,but they don't affect the movie in any important way.Kudos to Meghna Gulzar for trusting the audience with such a screenplay and Kudos for bringing such a story to the public.P.S.: There is something for Breaking Bad fans here too.I also got Homeland vibes from some scenes.\n",
      "Had the second half of the movie been executed a bit more efficiently, this could've have been an outstanding spy movie from bollywood, after a very long time. The movie takes us into the life of a 20 year old college going girl, Sehmat. The story revolves around the Indo-Pak war of 1971 from a perspective unknown to the common man. How suddenly things fall apart and this young girl's life changes drastically with choices beyond her reach is what unfolds in the movie. \n",
      "THE BACKGROUND SCORE & MUSIC\n",
      "The trio of Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy yet again pulls off a musical treat. The background score is aptly fitted. Every scene is filled to it's highest thrill with just the perfect blend of music and songs. Though the songs haven't been in the buzz much yet when it reflects in the movie, it just seem a pretty decent job.\n",
      "SCREENPLAY & DIALOGUES\n",
      "The writing duo here of Meghna-Bhavani, seems almost flawless and picture perfect in the first half. The story is in just the fine pace, with sufficient fillers to fill in. The dialogues are written very well by Meghna gulzar. She has adapted the urdu language very efficiently in the dialogues, keeping in mind the audience and their ability to interpret. \n",
      "With the second half, the narrative slightly looses it's track. It fails to maintain that grip over the audience. As we descend towards the climax, I even felt like it started to slightly diverge from its abstraction.\n",
      "CINEMATOGRAPHY\n",
      "The era of 70's has been showed pretty decently in the movie. Jay patel doesn't disappoints with his work. His shots and perspective of some intense scenes were really an asset to the movie. There are few close up shots, if I knew any better, still I'll admit to this fact that those shots completely changes the momentum of the impact of the scene over the audience. Capturing many low light scenes with such mastery, this man has done his job very profoundly. \n",
      "ACTING \n",
      "If I be very honest then this section absolutely grabs a full star. Alia Bhatt has yet again proved her worth in the industry, she's far more than just a cute face! Her acting is simply an excellence. She is so mesmerizing to watch that a lack of a male lead and the fact that this is a female centric becomes completely oblivious, if it at all is a bother to anyone in the very first place. A huge salute to the casting director Jogi. His works reflects effortlessly on the screen, with every actor fitting just so fine in their given character's shoes and also delivering it with so much conviction.\n",
      "Vicky kaushal, Arif Zakaria and Shishir Sharma are exceptional on screen, their work is truly outstanding. Special mention to Rajit Kapoor, having so less a screen time yet managed to leave a hard impact. Truly exceptional.\n",
      "After 'Talvar' (2015), I really liked Meghna's work. She really knows her way around the script, she knows how to and when to play what. Yet it was hurtful to see the second half slipping out like that. Nevertheless it's a brilliant work by her in bringing the world of sehmat alive on screen. It's definitely a must watch if you are a person with high patriotism and/or a great fan of Alia Bhatt.\n",
      "(Also check out 'movifeed' on instagram.)\n",
      "This from me is a One Time Watch.\n",
      "Until the interval, the film was slowly boiling but felt like something was missing. But a powerful scene just before the interval explained the whole film in a go. Sehmat undresses herself after a killing, stands under the shower and cries - the cries crack up the heart. One surrenders to the nation irrespective of the in-depth emotions, until Raazi came up the films relied more on nation. But, Meghna Gulzar proves, Emotion is greater than Nation.The complex nature of the film might come across as a defect, beneath the surface the heart is rapidly beating and the conflicts underline every character. The borders cease to exist, writers Bhavani Iyer and Meghna Gulzar team up to built a strong sense of emotional play. And this is just what I always expected from a war-torn film. The dynamics of \"Ae Watan\" play in context to both the countries, there's no hero or villain - humanity is. Bollywood has often patronised the term \"patriotism\", Raazi steps beyond it by taking up the humanistic approach brilliantly. And then, the following dialogue works as a paradox- \"Watan Ke Aage Kuch Bhi Nahi, Mohabbat Bhi Nahi (there's nothing beyond a nation, not even love)\", says Iqbal Syed.Sehmat played by Alia Bhatt carves into emotion during the shower scene, often her anxiety comes across childish which just stands as a mould. Watching the film with a peaceful mind might help to digest the thought properly, and I guess, our nation needs such a thought owing to the present \"nationalist\" agenda.\n",
      "The movie was average, however, the information they gave in the movie about Ind-Pak war in 1971 is wrong. In 1971, The war was between Bangladesh-Pakistan. They represent it in wrong way. I could have rated it higher but the information they provide is wrong and misleads the audience.\n",
      "All that hoopla about Alia Bhatt and the film .... huh. It is clear that the director has rushed the film towards the end! A 3 out of 10, not because the film was that bad but because it was shown and promoted as a blockbuster while it is not even remotely near to being a hit.\n",
      "Independent of your political/national affiliations, this is a very well made movie. There are hardly any loose ends. The director thought of all possible angles. For example, when Zehmat (Alia Bhatt) stumbles while planting evidence against Abdul, it ties back later when her husband finds evidence against her. \n",
      "The general atmosphere and 70s era is captured very well. If you love spy movies this is a must watch.\n",
      "Can't Bollywood even deliver a straightforward spy movie (*Baby is exception)\n",
      "Love story ghused do, melodrama ghused do\n",
      "Well .. Alia Bhatt knows how to cry in the reel world and boy she does it really well, like really well .. amongst all other 'acting' things ..\n",
      "And Meghna Gulzar surely knows how to direct a movie .. to be honest, there was no question after talvar but yeah raazi did put a stamp once again ..\n",
      "The dialogues have been really thought and worked upon when you could hear the \"kh\" from the epiglottis :DAlso, I am loving this age of cinema where not just the star kids or the prodigies are coming to play hero or, let us say, act .. but people have started taking it as a profession and they are getting breaks too .. Vicky Kaushal is one such example .. Movie brings life to a book titled 'Calling Sehmat' by Harinder S Sikka and never through the entire length would you find a need to go back and read it .. you know what I mean .. it is stitched quite beautifully. I did not notice any gaps in there.Would not want to add any more details as they tend to become spoilers more often than not .. but Raazi should be certainly given some of your time, in a theater.\n",
      "This is the best way to appreciate a good movie.And yeah .. we have got a new independence day song .. badly needed and is a good one after a long long time :)\n",
      "Among the few gifted directors is the name Meghna Gulzar who has blessed bollywood with a miracle like Talvar where the direction itself is enough to grip you to the movie for few weeks.With same brilliance and spark comes Raazi to question your thoughts over the unsung heroes & their selfless motives to keep India to peace.With showcase of dot to dot performance matched by realistic dialogues helped by strong background score, the movie does set a benchmark for Indo-Pak theme movies.From the opening scene to the last flash of the projector on the screen the story clearly outlines the failed relationship between the neighbouring nations India & Pakistan.\n",
      "Don't be confused Raazi is not a war movie or period drama but is an over the seat thriller with few intense moments that come unexpected.The fast pace of the movie assists in keeping your focus all over the screen.The way the story unfolds layer by layer delights your senses and all you wish is to keep up with ongoing events.\n",
      "What satisfies you the most is the efforts put in by both the lead actors as well as the supporting cast.Alia does justice to the role of an Indian Spy who under family pressure accepts what destiny throws to her and moulds herself to the expectation of her father.Alia has definitely out-performed her capabilities and has set new standards for a female-oriented movie.Vicky Kaushal on the other hand doesn't have much screen time but manages to establish himself as a strong character in the movie,with discipline of a soldier & innocence of a lover he manages to gain your affection.Jaideep Ahlawat is another pillar of the story who completely fits in the shoes of a 'Die for the nation' refugee who serves the country before anything else.\n",
      "Some other positives are the beautiful shoot location of Kashmir & the patriotic songs in the voice of Arijit Singh who connects you emotionally to the story of a young girl burdened under expectations.The silent chemistry between Alia Bhatt & Vicky Kaushal also adds flavor of love to the movie.Overall if you put Raazi under your judgment it sure delights you in each and every way possible with excellent performances and commendable direction.Go for the movie if you wish to put your respect in the efforts of the non-recognised heroes of our country.\n",
      "One of the best movies of 2018. Direction is very impressive as expected by meghna gulzar after talwar. Story and screen play will blow your mind in some of the scenes you would stop breathing and would imagine your self at Sehmat place. In terms of acting its really a performance driven movie which will be remembered for alia's best performances till now and rest of the cast is also amazing everyone has done thier best job. Background and music is also great but i would really appreciate karan johar to invest in such movies like kapoor and sons or raazi. I am happy that karan johar is moving towards quality cinema. Must watch.\n",
      "Every Indian has learnt to have a different yardstick for domestic and foreign films, and more so in more serious subject matters like this one here.\n",
      "You can feel a lot of lethargic writing in the script which just have too much to the mercy of luck and loopholes.\n",
      "Well directed, shot, edited and acted without doubt, and overall a great watch.\n",
      "Raazi is a film co-written and directed by Meghna Gulzar. The trailers seemed good to me and the ongoing positive reception, both, critically and commercially, compelled me to watch this film. And I can definitely say that this is one of the best of 2018.Plot: Sehmat is married to Iqbal Syed of the Pakistani army, so that she can pass information about Pakistan's actions against India during 1971.Story and direction: This film is adapted from the novel 'Calling Sehmat' by Harinder Sikka. This film has been very beautifully adapted by Meghna and Bhavani Iyer. The writing of the film is spot-on and never is it felt that the story was dragging. The character work of this film is also so intricate and detailed that I was in awe. The film not only showed that how spies work but also put light on the fact as to how difficult is a spy's work mentally. This aspect is highlighted most in this venture which was a risk and I salute Meghna and team for taking that risk. Here the Pakistani's are not shown as the enemies but as humans who would do anything to protect their country. The scenery of Kashmir and Pakistan were very well captured. But I did feel that I could guess some scenes. I am thinking that is just me. The character choices seemed very guessable, which was my only flaw with this film.Performances: Alia Bhatt once again proves that she is a great actress if given a compelling script. From the young college girl to the Indian spy, she played all the roles with ease. Vicky Kaushal was another of the gems of this film. Jaideep Ahlawat was an awesome mentor to Alia's character. Rajit Kapur, Shishir Sharma and Arif Zakaria also provided come great performances.Songs and BGM: This film has only three songs and all of them are good. Gulzar's lyrics and Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy's music were good. The songs never felt they were there to just fill in gaps. They moved the story forward and provided fuel to such a wonderful story. My favorite was 'Dilbaro'. The BGM felt good to the ears and not irritable as most Indian BGM's sound.Favorite Scene: It would be the one in the beginning where Hidayat tells Sehmat to return to college and resume her studies. But then Sehmat replies that if her father can serve the nation why not her. The kind of maturity seen in that particular scene is what made an impression on my mind and my favourite.Verdict: Meghna Gulzar is proving to be one of the compelling female directors of recent times. First Talvar and now Raazi. This film's different take on a spy genre and Alia's performance make this a must watch. I am going with a 9/10 with this one.\n",
      "Boring , predicatable and totally not worth the time . Don't know why the high ratings .\n",
      "I didn't understand what type of this movie in any class going rubbish acting directing only get 1star\n",
      "Acting was good but plot failed to impress unrealistic at times overall a one time watch.\n",
      "Duration: 140 Minutes\n",
      "Genre: Spy Thriller\n",
      "CAST\n",
      "Alia Bhatt : She portrays Sehmat Khan. Alia is confident in her role. Sehmat represents a character who is brave and equally helpless and she performs this flawlessly, definitely one of Bollywood's most dedicated actress.\n",
      "Vicky Kaushal : He portrays Iqbal Syed, Sehmat's Pakistani husband. Vicky performed well with the limited screen space, he complemented Alia in every way. \n",
      "Rajit Kapoor who plays Hidayat Khan, Shishir Sharma who plays Brigadier Syed, and Jaideep Ahlawad who plays Khalid Mir were all vital supporting actors. PLOT\n",
      "The story of Raazi is about an Indian girl who marries into a Pakistan army family in order to spy on them during the India - Pakistan war in 1971. The script is based on a book titled 'Calling Sehmat' by Harinder S Sikka, and it keeps you gripped thru out it's length. Director Meghna Gulzar, writes and directs beautifully. SOUNDTRACK\n",
      "The tracks of Raazi are deep, meaningful and bring in that patriotic feel. \n",
      "Favorite track : Ae Watan. Overall Raazi is spy thriller which is not to be missed. It's definitely a winner for Dharma Productions and Junglee Pictures.\n",
      "Such brilliant acting, but the direction and screenplay is a big let down, the songs are pretty good too, a decent one time watch, but nothing great\n",
      "The most overrated film in recent times, there's obviously something really suspicious and a clear bias about the ratings and reviews here, apart from Alia Bhatt's commendable performance, there's nothing to look forward to in this totally predictable, slowly-paced, lengthy film, a waste of time!\n",
      "Waste of time movie... I dont get it how it became hit and got this much rating....i will rate it not more then 2 stars... Story is like anything... whatever writer wanted to write he wrote it... Just hating myself why the heck I watched this movie....\n"

      "The director did a masterful technique of placing the audience in Sehmat's shoes, the audience is privy to the information as she receives n passes on to the Intelligence bureau. Alia Bhatt as Sehmat did a terrific job n Vicky Kaushal as her husband was an icing on the cake. The scene of the marriage consummation is aptly placed.\n",

      "This is entirely unglamorous, but the film does have an underlying tension n relies on the impending sense of dread which hangs over Sehmat's entire investigation.\n",
      "Ther r two scenes wher Sehmat is almost exposed n the reaction n facial expression of Alia during those two scenes were amazing.\n",

      "Based on an incredible true story, Raazi is a tribute to unknown heroes of our nation in war time zone. Directed by Meghna Gulzar, who had directed extremely well movie- Talvar in past, this film tells a story about a normal and simple Indian girl, and her journey from being a daughter to a wife and to a spy. One more factor is also there, but am not revealing now because you will get it at the end.Alia Bhatt plays a character of Sehmat, who is an Indian spy married to a Pakistani military officer (Vicky Kaushal) during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 on the order of her father. Would she get success to pass on information from Pakistan to India without getting caught and to help Indian forces to stop the war or fight back to Pakistan.... For that go and watch Raazi.It is an adaptation of Harinder Sikka's novel 'Calling Sehmat'. Screenplay has been written by Meghna and Bhavani Iyer. Dialogues are written by Meghna. Some dialogues are outstanding. 'Watan Ke Aage Kuch Nahi, Khud Bhi Nahi... Mohabbat Bhi Nahi!' One more is there, when one is declaring about his cancer, he says that- 'Smoking To Ki Nahi Kabhi... Magar Shayad Zindagi ke Kash Thode Lambe Le Liye...!' What a line man! Only a daughter of a great poet can write such!Alia Bhatt has delivered another award winning performance. Till now in this year, she is the deserving one. First time you will see her crying. Especially, in that scene where she is asking his officer about how to balance between life, emotions and duty in war, because it is the toughest one. VIcky Kaushal is as usaul superb. He has less dialogues, but his silences speak more. The gun scene with Alia is the best scene of these two actors. Jaideep Ahlawat has done commendable job. He is always good. But this time he is on another level. Along with Rajit Kapur and Soni Razdan, rest are good, too.Lyrics by Gulzar Saheb and Music by Shankar Ehsaan Loy. Dilbaro is pure Kashmiri folk song on the perfect situation of marriage saying- 'Mudke Na Dekho Dilbaro!' Raazi title track is engaging. Whenever Arijit's voice starts in the hall, some magic happens everytime in this film. School annual function song by Sunidhi and the same song in Arijit Singh's voice - 'Ae Watan'- is the best song that Gulzar Saheb can give us in this decade. What a melody man! Looks like a classic old hindi film tune. For the film situated in 1971, this is the best patriotic song one can ever make! I am so proud of this song... 'Main Jahan Rahun Jahaan Mein Yaad Rahe Tu, Ae Watan... Mere Watan!'I knew that this film would be superb. But this song has uplifted it more. But the same time, it's touching the deepest portion of heart. Human is very complicated creature. Human is not a robot. For anyone, it is hard to be a robot. One can try one's best, but one can't delete the function of emotions from the body. Without emotions, there is no living. Salute to those heroes who are living without emotions so that millions of people from their countries can live happily! If a girl can go to this level for her father and her nation, what can you or I do at current position! The question is unanswered by me. I am still thinking (while writing as well!) The more I think of it, the more I am getting deeper in the thought. The story of a courageous girl is definitely a Must Watch. You'll feel proud of such unsung heroes of your country. Feel the emotions of them. Feel the tension of espionage. Feel the heat of war. As they say- In the War, nothing is important than War, neither you, nor me!\n"
