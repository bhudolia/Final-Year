# Overview
Sentiment analysis with Devansh Nema and [Devansh Bhudolia](https://github.com/bhudolia/Final-Year). The main focus of this project is to understand how to create a neural network that can analyze a review and classify it as bad or good.
It is split into several parts:
- Curating a data set.
